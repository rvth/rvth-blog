&lt;p&gt;My first experience with Code First Girls was in February 2020. I still can't believe I walked into a room in Goldman Sachs in Holborn full of strangers, to start learning to code.

&lt;p&gt;There's no question about how amazing and enriching owning a dog can be.  But it also a huge commitment and with the wonderful things, also comes the less pleasant factors which everyone should be aware of if they are thinking of getting a dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytrends/"&gt; Pytrends&lt;/a&gt; is the unofficial API for Google Trends that allows you to automate the process of downloading different reports from Google Trends and can be used within Python to collect data using the different methods available within the API.&lt;/p&gt;
